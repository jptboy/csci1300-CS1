class Library
{
    public members:
        setUsers function
            -input filestream that reads data and constructs users objects and constructs user objects and puts into an array
        setBooks function
            -input filestream that reads data and constrcuts books objects and puts them into an array

        addUser function
            - utilizes the user class and its methods
        login function
        quit function
            -output filestream
        view function
        rate function
        recomender function
    private members:
        array of books objects
        array of users objects
            -will need necessary syntax for object arrays

}

we probably need some fileio algorithims and for loops and object array algorithims
writing psuedocode for a class is weird without knowing how all this will actually work

Library:: setUsers
{
    use the User class to create arrays of users
}

Library::setBooks
{
    use the books class to create arrays of books
}
Library::view
{
    will use the two classes to print out ratings
}
Library::quit
{
    we will write this function just some fileio
}
Library::addUser
{
   use the user class and its methods
}
Library::rate
{
   use the book class and its functions
}
Library::reccomend
{
   we will use the algorithim provided
}
