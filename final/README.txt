My project is a lot like the library project except that it is more complicated and tracks the money that the customers spend and customers can even try to shoplift and try to avoid getting caught.
I have a text file for customer data and a text file for item data and for tracking days.
I will have a text file tracking the days that the store is open too because managers will be able to order items(any item can get ordered the customers just have to wait) if customers cannot find them.
Managers can order items and customers can be caught for stealing.
